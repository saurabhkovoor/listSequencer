Adds a button to the classic editor toolbar for setting the start attribute values to the lists in selection, hence treating the selected lists as one sequence.

== Description ==

List Sequencer adds a simple yet powerful functionality to the WordPress Classic Editor. With this plugin, users can select multiple ordered lists (ol) and treat them as a continuous sequence, even if they are separated by images, paragraphs, or other elements. This feature is particularly useful for content that requires uninterrupted list numbering across different sections.

Key Features:
- Combine separated ordered lists into one continuous list.
- Automatically adjust the start number of list items.
- Easy to use with a single click in the classic editor toolbar.
- Supports multiple ordered lists within the same editor content.

Note: Hierarchical ordered lists (nested lists) are currently not supported.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'listSequencer-main' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use the 'List Sequencer' button in the classic editor toolbar to adjust your lists.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin with the Gutenberg editor? =

No, this plugin is designed for the Classic Editor only.

= Does it support nested ordered lists? =

Currently, nested ordered lists are not supported. The plugin works with top-level ordered lists in the editor.
