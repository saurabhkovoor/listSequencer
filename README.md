# List Sequencer

List Sequencer is a WordPress plugin designed for the Classic Editor that enhances the functionality of ordered lists. It allows users to treat multiple separated ordered lists as a continuous sequence, even when interspersed with images, paragraphs, or other elements.

This is particularly useful for content that requires consistent list numbering across different sections.

## Description

The plugin adds a button to the Classic Editor's toolbar. When used, it adjusts the start values of ordered lists within the selected content, treating them as part of a single continuous list.

Please note that hierarchical (nested) ordered lists are currently not supported.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin from the WordPress Plugin Directory or clone it from the GitHub repository.
2. Upload the `list-sequencer` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. The 'List Sequencer' button will now be available in the Classic Editor toolbar.

## Usage

1. Select the ordered list items in your editor that you want to sequence.
2. Click the 'List Sequencer' button in the toolbar.

With just these 2 steps, you can adjust the numbering as a continuous sequence.
